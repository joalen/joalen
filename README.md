## Hi, I'm Alen Jo! 
Take a peek around and see some of the projects I have in store for you (or repositories I found to contribute to)! My projects don't bite (or so I think) :D

## Skills
Some skills gained throughout my professional, personal, and academic settings.

## Tinkering With / Works in Progress
- **SAGE by ACM UT Dallas**: Collaborating and leading efforts in developing an advising solution for college students at UT Dallas
- **Nexity (a Haskell Compiler Flavor)**: Since I'm doing a course on programming language paradigms, I wanted to revisit this project and make some cool editions that can make this compiler robust and a nice-to-use
- **Heartcheck (a 2023 Axxess Hackathon project)**: Felt like I neglected to update this app further and wanted to give it a refresh with a better backend strategy and a sort of "plug-in-play" way of using this application
